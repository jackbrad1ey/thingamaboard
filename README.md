# Thingamaboard
A custom keyboard designed and manufactured for myself. Programmed using STM32CubeIDE and Jetbrains Fleet, designed using [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen), AutoCAD and Solidworks.

This board was designed with portability and ergonomics in mind. It adopts a columnar, alice-like layout with three-key thumb clusters, allowing for ergonomic typing in a relatively small and portable form factor.
