# Thingamaboard
A custom keyboard designed and manufactured for myself, designed and programmed using KiCad, AutoCAD, Solidworks and STM32CubeIDE.

The board takes on a columnar alice-like layout, with three-key thumb clusters, allowing for ergonomic typing in a relatively small and portable form factor.
