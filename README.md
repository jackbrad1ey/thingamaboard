# Thingamaboard
A custom keyboard designed and manufactured for myself, designed and programmed using KiCad, AutoCAD, Solidworks and STM32CubeIDE.

The board was designed with portability and ergonomics in mind. It takes on a columnar alice-like layout with three-key thumb clusters, allowing for ergonomic typing in a relatively small and portable form factor.
